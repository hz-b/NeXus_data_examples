This repositroy collects the example of NeXus data conversion for various experiment techniques of BESSY II.

- [ICALEPCS 2025](https://github.com/hz-b/NeXus_data_examples/tree/main/2025_ICALEPCS): In this example, we convert the experiment data from mySpot beamline of BESSY II to two NeXus application definitons ([NXfluo](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXfluo.html) and [NXmonopd](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXmonopd.html)). The experiment inculdes the simultanous measurement on the sample with two experiment techniques, fluoroscence and X-ray differaction, to correlate the occurrence of crystalline phases with the elemental distribution.
